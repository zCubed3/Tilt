# Manta Engine [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/0-percent-optimized.svg)](https://forthebadge.com) [![forthebadge](https://forthebadge.com/images/badges/built-with-resentment.svg)](https://forthebadge.com)

## DISCLAIMER: I am still quite new to C/C++! Any stupid and obvious errors are due to my general lack of experience with such low level languages! This engine isn't meant to be used for anything other than learning, it is unstable and lacks quite a lot of features!

The Manta engine is a one man project to build a basic game engine capable of making basic games with. It is in no way meant to compete with Unreal, Unity, Godot, and any other game engine developed by professionals. This project may be abandoned in the future depending on my motivation.

Parts of this software are inspired from features inside of well known game engines such as Id Tech 2 / Source, namely the console, on the surface they're functionally similar but I've extended the behaviour of my console implementation to fit my enigine's needs.

This software was written using NeoVim with many customizations and plugins to make it adequate for C/C++ and C# programming. Any formatting issues are the result of Vim and poor programming practices.

(If I can get a working M1 Mac sometime in the future I will work on porting the engine to MacOS and iOS)

### Build instructions / requirements

**Disclaimer: If using Windows, please install Cygwin or any other Windows-POSIX compilation layer**

**Warning: If projects/engine_data isn't copied into the binary directory automatically, please do it manually since the engine will not function properly without it! (copy it and rename it to "data")**

#### Compilation requirements

1. CMake (3.19 or higher)
2. Compilers
    * GNU GCC or LLVM Clang
3. Libraries
    * GLEW
    * GLFW3
4. Mono (for Mono scripting support)

#### Compiling the code

1. Create the project files using CMake
    1. Run configure.sh and pick your compiler or run `./configure COMPILER_NAME "debug"/"release"` Ex: `./configure clang debug` would generate a debug build built with Clang
2. Compile the project
    1. After having ran `./configure` run `./build`, it'll run make and copy over engine content to the build
